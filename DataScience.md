# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the field of learning from data in a supervised or unsupervised manner. It is mostly based on methods from statistics which
- provides models to approximate the observed data and make predictions
- evaluates the matching between observed and predicted data
- evaluates the quality and statistical stability of models, e.g. by testing the model output on modified sets of data

# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence includes and makes use of machine learning. Its a much larger field that tries to reach several goals:
- Reasoning from data
- Understanding concepts inherent to data
- Find solutions to problems such as road map planning,
- Develop models that approximate human learning and reasoning

Data can be
- texts
- 2D/3D images and videos
- audio
- analog and digital signals
- patterns of any form
