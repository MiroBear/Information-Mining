# Questions
## Deep Learning
- Partial input features provided to NNs
- Feedback loop to learn which samples help in achieving better accuracy
  or which are required to improve the classification for samples less
  frequent in the data source, i.e. some way to automatically achieve
  homogeneous distribution of classes.
- Semantic knowledge learned by NNs

## Statistics
- Distribution free machine learning algorithms
  - Avoiding problems like models that require normality

# Topics for Machine Learning

## Medical

## Music
- Generation from images
- Matching for images / environments
  - Algorithms: trees, building, general picture, time, map info,

## Images
- Segmentation of images, object identification, mood estimation
- Illustrative modification of image
- Generation of / Selection of images based on mood / intention / marketing goals

# Bookmark Clustering
- Text based
- Web crawler / Google API: download text of web pages, check if valid content, dead link detection
- Algorithms
  - SOM
  - Tree map
  - SVM
  - Graph visualization

Evaluation of Software Development
- Evaluate requirements, quality of detail, quality of estimates,
- SVN complexity of check-ins,

## Game Theory

## Climate change solutions
- People in desperate situation
- Solutions
- Food
- Migration
- Avoiding traffic
- Help people to help themselves
- Educate people
- Don’t focus on quality of life, more on sustainability

## ML for good
- detect greedy behavior in humans and machines
- game theory backed algorithm to learn what’s fair and unfair
- detect systems that harm people, groups, nature, environment
- system to raise awareness for human influence on life on planet
- maintain equilibrium instead of creating inequality

# Data Sources
